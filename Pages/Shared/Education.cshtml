                <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Information Technology in 
                    Computer Application Development at Varsity College.My studies
                    have provided me with a strong foundation in software 
                    development, data analytics, and cloud computing.But my coding 
                    didn’t begin in college, it began in Parktown High School where my grade 
                    was the first cohort of girls to take IT as a subject in grade 10.
                    There I was introduced to programming; I learnt perseverance in 
                    that class because I didn’t grasp programming as quickly as my 
                    peers did but that didn’t stop me.I then went on to take IT in 
                    college, but I still struggled and now I’m here.Three years later, in my 
                    final year, and finishing my degree in record time!
